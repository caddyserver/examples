# ThinkJS

This is an example configuration on how to use [ThinkJS](https://thinkjs.org) with Caddy.

The configuration takes following assumptions:

1. The ThinkJS installation path is `/var/www/example.com`.
2. ThinkJS listens on port `8360`.
3. You use domain name `example.com`.

Please be sure to change with your actual values.

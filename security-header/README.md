# Security Header

Get an **A+** on [security header](https://securityheaders.com/) out of the box. These settings are well tested on websites in PROD.

Before I was using CloudFlare worker (5$ per month) to get the same result. I asked myself, how does the â€˜real serverâ€™ are configured to manage the scurity-header? This is how.

This is part of my project:

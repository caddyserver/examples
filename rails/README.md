# Ruby on Rails

This is an example `Caddyfile` for a rails project. This project assumes you are using [puma](http://puma.io/) as your webserver; however, using a different one like Unicorn shouldn't be too difficult to change.

The paths are shown as if you deplyed with [capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/). The actual paths on your server may vary.

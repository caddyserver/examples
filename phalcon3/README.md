# PhalconPHP

This is an example configuration on how to use [Phalcon3](https://phalconphp.com/en/) with Caddy.

The configuration takes the following assumptions:

1. You've installed php7.0-fpm
2. You've installed Phalcon3
3. Caddy is serving off port 80

Please be sure to change with your actual values.

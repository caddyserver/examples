## Hosting a [hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) blog fronted by caddy

This assumes only the following things :
 - You have `caddy` installed and selected the `git` and `-hugo` plugins during the download
 - You may or may not have `hugo` installed. If not, the `hugo` plugin will automatically fetch the latest version from the github releases of [hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases)
 
 
### Note : Caddy 0.8.3 is the recommended version until plugin authors update their middleware and caddyserver.com/download starts builds of 0.9

## Hosting a [hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) blog fronted by caddy

This assumes only the following things :
 - You have `caddy` installed and selected the `caddy-git` and `caddy-hugo` plugins during the download
 - You have `hugo` installed. You can either grab it from the github [releases](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/releases) of hugo, or if you're running a recent Ubuntu, use `apt install hugo`
 
 
 
### Note : Caddy 0.8.3 is the recommended version until plugin authors update their middleware and caddyserver.com/download starts builds of 0.9

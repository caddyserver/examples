---------------------------
Drupal ♥️ Caddy

Example Caddy configuration file to get started with Caddy.
There are rewrites to block access module files, SQL files, and several other extensions that should not be accessible via the web server. It also blocks access to dot files. 

You will need to change the site URL, root, and php-fpm information for this to work.
